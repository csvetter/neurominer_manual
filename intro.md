Machine learning techniques are poised to become clinically useful
methods that may be used for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment
decisions. Despite this, they are currently underutilised in medical
studies, and moreso in psychiatric research because most current tools
require strong programming and computational engineering skills (e.g.,
scikit-learn, caret, Weka, nilearn). While there are some great tools
that do not require programming experience (e.g., PRoNTo), these tools
are often limited to making predictions from domain-specific modalities
such as neuroimaging data. This highlights a pressing need for a
user-friendly machine learning software that makes advanced methods
available to clinical researchers from different fields, aiming at
collaboratively developing diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic tools
for precision medicine approaches.
